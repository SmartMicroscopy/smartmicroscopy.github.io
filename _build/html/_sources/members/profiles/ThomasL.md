# Laurent Thomas  
I am an engineer in biotechnology by training, I joined the company [ACQUIFER](https://www.acquifer.de/) in 2017 for a PhD, working on image-analysis, mostly focusing on object-detection applied to microscopy.  
I released [Multi-Template-Matching](https://multi-template-matching.github.io/Multi-Template-Matching/), an object-detection plugin for Fiji and a python package as part of this project.  
I am now working as a software developer for the company, and still playing with object-detection and smart-microscopy.   
As part of the working group, I hope to make these workflows more accessible, and widely applicable.
