# Website of the Smart Microscopy Working Group

**Smart or Adaptive Feedback Microscopy** aims at connecting bioimage analysis (and other algorithms) with fully motorized and computer-controlled microscopes to generate automated and adaptive imaging workflows. This strategy can also be used to manage changes in the sampleâ€™s environment (e.g. fluidic devices) and directly link the microscope to image data management systems.

## Mission

While several software solutions for microscopy control exist and can be used to implement smart-microscopy workflows, there is no reference specification of what functionalities are needed, or how these workflows could be implemented. To facilitate the development of smart-microscopy applications, and enable their execution across imaging-systems with similar modalities, we are working to establish such a standard specification. 

The working group is composed of participants from both academia and industry, meeting regularly online with the support of the Euro-BioImaging Industry Board.

## Compiling the book locally
First you need a python installation.  
Then you need to install jupyter-book, either with `pip install -U jupyter-book` or `conda install -c conda-forge jupyter-book`.  
Clone this repository locally (or download the repo as a zip from github.com).  
In the repository root directory, open a command prompt (on windows, type `cmd` in the address bar).  
In the command prompt, type `./build_book.sh`, to run all the build scripts.

Note : If you get a message like *jupyter-book is not a recognized command*, make sure the directory containing the `jupyter-book.exe` is on your PATH. (On windows see environment variables).  

## Adding a profile
To add a new member profile, add the profile in `members/profiles/LastnameF.md`, then link the file in `members.md` & `_toc.yml`.
