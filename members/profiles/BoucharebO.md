# Otmane Bouchareb
I am an entrepreneur specializing in electronics engineering, with an expertise on electronics, robotics, automation, and smart microscopy.

I co-founded Inscoper, a company dedicated to developing cutting-edge microscopy software solutions, and currently serves as its Managing Director.

Inscoper's flagship product is a universal acquisition software that integrates automation and deep learning, transforming traditional microscopes into autonomous, event-driven systems. 

I have contributed to research in automated and fluorescence microscopy. I co-authored several publications.
My work continues to push the boundaries of robotics and automation in microscopy, enabling smarter, faster, and more reliable data acquisition for scientific research.
