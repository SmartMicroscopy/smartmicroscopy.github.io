# Thomas Guilbert
I am a physicist specialising in optics by training, and obtained my PhD in multiphoton microscopy in 2010 in Rennes, Brittany, France.

I spent 15 years working on a light microscopy core-facility at IMAG'IC (Institut Cochin, Paris), where I interacted with hundreds of users and specialised in data management and machine quality monitoring for reproducibility.

I now work for Inscoper (Cesson-Sévigné, Brittany, France), a young innovative company offering a range of cutting-edge microscope control solutions. 

In particular, the Roboscope falls into the category of smart microscopes and should enable us to improve efficiency and speed while drastically reducing data production.

Pro-active in the field of open science, this working group is a great opportunity to work on harmonising upstream methods.
