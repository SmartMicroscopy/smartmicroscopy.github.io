My mission is to democratize microscopy. With our little cube-system "UC2" we have layed out the foundation of open-source modular optics systems at the Leibniz Institute of Photonic Technologies. 
We have tried almost any microscopy technique with the modular framework. Now it's the time to scale it up and bring it to the people to help them create new concepts and setups. 
Our goal is to create an ecosystem of tools consisting of optics, electronics, software and parts - like what the Arduino or Raspberry Pi has done for Electronics; but for optics.
