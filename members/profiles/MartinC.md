# CÃ©lia Martin

I am an engineer in embedded systems, graduated in 2020.
I joined the company Inscoper in 2019 for an intership, working on test automation.
I am now working as an software developer for the company, on the automation part in a smart microscopy project, called Roboscope.
I created a modular architecture, to ensure genericity.
