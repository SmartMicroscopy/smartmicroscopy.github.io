# Rémy Torro
I am a physicist, specialized in statistics and image analysis. I defended my PhD thesis in 2024 in Marseille, France, focusing on the development of a bioimage analysis software for biologist end-users, leveraging traditional and AI methods.

I recently joined the company Inscoper (Cesson-Sevigné, France) as their image treatment and AI engineer to bridge the gap between microscopy acquisition and bioimage analysis.

After working closely with exerimentalists on the challenges of post-acquisition image analysis, my focus is now to develop image analysis algorithms to drive smart(er) microscopes.
