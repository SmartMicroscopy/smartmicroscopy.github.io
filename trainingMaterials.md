# Training Materials (in development)

We aim to formalise individual concepts (such as standard workflows or essential commands) as separate structured training modules. Each concept is to be illustrated with examples using commercial or open-source platforms. 

The training material is disseminated through our website for use in courses or as a reference material for other activities. It can also be used by researchers aiming to integrate microscopy automation and feedback strategies into their work.

## Motivation
* Create description of essential Smart Microscopy concepts in platform-agnostic manner
* Link concepts to the implementations in different packages
* Create knowledge based to be used for future training purposes


## Acknowledgments
This activity was inspired by the success of the bioimage analysis community, which implemented this concept to develop extensive [image analysis training materials](https://neubias.github.io/training-resources/). Individual Smart Microscopy modules are currently hosted on the image analysis training resource. We particularly thank Christian Tischer for technical support and advice.
