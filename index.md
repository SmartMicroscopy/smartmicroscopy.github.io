# Smart Microscopy Working Group

**Smart or Adaptive Feedback Microscopy** aims at connecting bioimage analysis (and other algorithms) with fully motorized and computer-controlled microscopes to generate automated and adaptive imaging workflows. This strategy can also be used to manage changes in the sampleâ€™s environment (e.g. fluidic devices) and directly link the microscope to image data management systems.

## Mission

While several software solutions for microscopy control exist and can be used to implement smart-microscopy workflows, there is no reference specification of what functionalities are needed, or how these workflows could be implemented. To facilitate the development of smart-microscopy applications, and enable their execution across imaging-systems with similar modalities, we are working to establish such a standard specification.

The working group is composed of participants from both academia and industry, meeting regularly online with the support of the Euro-BioImaging Industry Board.
